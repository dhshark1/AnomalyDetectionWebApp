Need to think about:
- Constructor of CLI: (it should copy all the cmds because of encapsulation or we should not put any attention on this thing here)
                        Part answer: accoridng to Eli's code CLI does not get command** with its constructor.
- How to manage the client choises on CLI: (CLI should be command? because if it is it can...)
                        Part answer: CLI got a DefaultIO in his constructor. so It shoudl talk with the client with read and write;

-Constructor of Command: (should it get DefaultIO and Description? and if it is, it should copy the DefaultIO because of encapsulation?)
                         Partly answer: in Eli's code he gets a DefaultIO, I added to it to get a Desc also based on Eli's PDF presentation.


 - I am not sure that this is the right syntax:
 "
     UploadCommand(DefaultIO* dio, string s): Command(dio, s){

     }
 "

- Can I assume that option 3 wont be called before option 1?
